# Color Clock
I am attempting to replicate [a color clock](https://jenniferdewalt.com/color_clock.html), whereby the background color changes with each passing second of a digital clock. 

## Schedule 
- __Monday__: 
  - Review HTML, CSS, and Hex color codes
  - Review MDN documentation for getting time
- __Tuesday__:
  - Structure HTML doc with CSS
  - Pseudocode and stub main JS function
- __Wednesday__:
  - Write code for main JS function
  - Write tests for main JS function
- __Thursday__:
  - Run code
  - Rework code to fix bugs & improve functionality
- __Friday__:
  - Retouch any HTML and CSS

## Possible Needed Functions
- __Javascript functions__
  - Some kind of *Date()* method to calculate current time
  - Utilize *Math.random* method to find a random Hex color between 0-16 for each second 
    ###### *If number is 16 (or F) at ones place of Hex, increment tens place by one. Once tens place is 16 (or F), increment hundreds place. Continue this logic with all other places.*

### Other Projects
- __Scrambled__:
  - I would like to attempt this [_Scrambled_ project](https://jenniferdewalt.com/scrambled.html). The object of the game is to figure out the correct word in 3 attempts or less. This project would require both Javascript and Jquery. 
- __Hangman__:
  - This simple [_Hangman_ project](https://jenniferdewalt.com/hangman/game) would be so much fun to tackle! It's essentially the same as the __*Scrambled*__ project with animation. This project would require both Javascript and Jquery.
